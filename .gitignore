# EDUCATIONAL .GITIGNORE
# This file demonstrates git ignore patterns with detailed explanations for learning purposes.
# In typical projects, these comments would be minimal, but our educational philosophy
# prioritizes understanding over brevity. Each section explains both what files are excluded
# and why excluding them follows development best practices.

# DEPENDENCIES - Files installed by package managers
# node_modules/ contains thousands of library files that npm/yarn downloads
# These are huge, change frequently, and can be recreated from package.json
node_modules/      # See comment above
npm-debug.log*     # Error logs from npm (Node Package Manager)
yarn-debug.log*    # Error logs from Yarn (alternative to npm)
yarn-error.log*

# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES - Files containing sensitive information
# .env files store API keys, passwords, database URLs - never commit these!
# Each developer needs their own copy with their specific credentials
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# BUILD OUTPUTS - Generated files that get created from source code
# /build contains the compiled/minified version of your React app
# /dist is another common name for distribution/build files
# These are recreated each time you build, so no need to store in git
/build
/dist

# IDE FILES - Editor-specific configuration files
# .vscode/ stores Visual Studio Code settings (personal preferences)
# .idea/ stores JetBrains IDE settings (IntelliJ, WebStorm, etc.)
# .swp/.swo are temporary files created by Vim text editor
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# OPERATING SYSTEM FILES - Files your OS creates automatically
# .DS_Store is created by macOS in every folder (stores folder view settings)
# Thumbs.db is created by Windows (stores thumbnail cache)
# These are system files that other developers don't need
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
